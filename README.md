Part 1: Modules
Defines two functions in the same file:

add(a, b) → returns the sum of two numbers.

subtract(a, b) → returns the difference of two numbers.

Demonstrates how modules normally work in Node.js.

Part 2: File System (Blocking vs Non-Blocking)
Blocking Read: Uses fs.readFileSync() to read a file synchronously.

Non-Blocking Read: Uses fs.readFile() to read a file asynchronously.

A sample file sample.txt is created automatically.

Part 3: Asynchronous Programming
Simulates fetching user data with setTimeout.

Logs "Data received" after 5 seconds.
